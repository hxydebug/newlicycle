# Licycle
This Licycle project is about a bicycle-based robot which can cross obstacles without falling over. You can see the performance in the following video.

#### Introduction
A part of Licycle project, the code of the upper-level computer.

#### Function
The upper computer communicates with the lower microcontroller through the Uart serial port, and then drives the hub and steer motor indirectly. And leg motors communicate via a controller area network (CAN) and use an adapter to communicate with the upper computer to implement a frequency of 1000 Hz for leg actuation. An inertial measurement unit (IMU) is used for obtaining bikebot attitude and acceleration.
